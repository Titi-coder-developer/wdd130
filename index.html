        <p>
            Hello! My name is Chinweokwu Clementina Adindu, but you can call me Tina. I am from Isialangwa North in Abia
            State, Nigeria,
            currently based in Onitsha, Anambra State. I hold a B.Sc. in Food Science and Technology from Michael Okpara
            University of Agriculture,
            Umudike, in October 2024.

            I have professional experience working as a Sales Representative at Cikem Veterinary Clinic, where I
            developed strong
            skills in customer relations and inventory management. Before that, I worked as a Computer Graphics Designer
            and a
            Cashier Representative, which helped me gain creativity, communication, and organizational skills.

            I am passionate about technology and software development and currently learning full-stack development to
            become a
            proficient web developer. Beyond academics and work, I enjoy reading, problem-solving, and contributing to
            my church and
            community.

            My goal for the next year is to improve my programming skills, work on real-life tech projects, and prepare
            for a
            successful career while maintaining a balanced personal life.
