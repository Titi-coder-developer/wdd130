            <p>
                Hello! My name is Chinweokwu Clementina Adindu, but you can call me Tina. Iâ€™m from Isialangwa North, Abia State, and
                currently live in Onitsha, Anambra State. I hold a B.Sc. in Food Science and Technology from Michael Okpara University
                of Agriculture, Umudike (2024).
                
                I have experience as a Sales Representative, Computer Graphics Designer, and Cashier, which helped me build strong
                customer service, communication, and organizational skills. I am passionate about technology and currently learning
                full-stack development to become a proficient web developer.
                
                My goal for the next year is to sharpen my programming skills, work on real-life tech projects, and prepare for a
                successful career.
            </p>
